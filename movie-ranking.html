<h2>All Dogs Go To Heaven</h2>
<p> Animated film about a dog who has died but is sent back to Earth to prove that he can be a "Good Dog" and enter Heaven. This is a childhood classic!</p>

<h2>The Adjustment Bureau</h2>
<p>This movie gives a uncanny look into the decisions we make both small and big and hoe they can have rippiling effects in both a personal lives and our environment. This movie really makes you think about your actions and the effects they may have</p>

<h2>World War Z</h2>
<p>Best interpretation of a zombie outbreak I have ever seen. </p>

<p>Marvel anti-hero turned comedian, one of the best action comedies ever! </p>
